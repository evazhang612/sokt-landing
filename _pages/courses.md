## Sample Technical Courses 
I proposed, designed and taught CS81SI AI Interpretability & Fairness at Stanford listed under [CS81SI archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200712083118/http://cs81si.stanford.edu/) in Spring 2020, with the invaluable support of my faculty sponsors Professor [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) and Professor [Omer Reingold](https://omereingold.wordpress.com/). For background on the class and similar class offerings, please check out this School of Engineering [post](https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/how-computer-science-department-teaching-ethics-its-students). For more information on the course, please feel free to reach out to me. 


## Thoughts on what classes to take for people who are exactly me at Stanford.  

I have been asked for class recommendations and 4 year plans a few times, and compiled the below for anyone else curious. 

As a general rule of thumb, I tried to take interesting classes with content hard to master on my own. Sounds like an intuitive thing, but hard to follow since everyone feels a bit pressured to lay out a 4 year plan the day before Freshman year even started. 

which had content I would find interesting and more difficult to master on my own. (This also goes for interesting topics or people I wouldn't otherwise meet). I then chose the major based on the classes I took the most, and then filled in the gaps with the major requirements. 

This meant that most of the time, I took electives before the core and sometimes self-studied prerequisites to skip to the stuff I find interesting or to be able to take classes with professors I want to learn from. Execution of a class is sometimes just (if not more) important than the content it contained. This can be especially advantageous if your major offers classes with professors you want to learn from, once a year or once every 2 years. I didn't want to wait 2 years for all the stars to align. 

This approach may not be advisable depending on how you learn. Sometimes there will be prerequisite cycles. E.g. I took CS103, CS109, and CS229 in the same quarter. As you may know, 103 is technically a prerequisite for 109, and 109 is a prerequisite for 229.

The above approach worked ok at Stanford where you don't have to declare a major until Junior year (or Senior year if you're ok with a couple of angry sounding emails). It also worked ok because sometimes you can petition out of requirements if you took something  more advanced, and if you happen to choose a major that is a bit more flexible. If you're majoring in Chemical Engineering or interested in Med. School, this approach would be unadvisable (or so I imagine). In retrospect, a lot of the moving pieces fit together by pure chance. I chose to do the above because I find it much easier to take "difficult" classes that I'm interested in than "easy" classes I am disinterested in. This all depends on where you are on this interest vs difficulty tradeoff spectrum. Of course, if there are interesting classes that aren't as time-consuming, then great!

The approach in the other direction which work well for most people go with is to take intro. classes that count for a lot of majors and then pick electives accordingly. This is probably the most commonly advised approach. One thing to note here is that advanced classes dive deeper but also more intimate, and sometimes the support system for learning is a bit better than large intro. classes that feel impersonal. Many times by the time you go back and take intro. classes for one reason or the other you will have already learned the same topics in advanced classes in detail so everything comes more naturally, AND you have managed to make sure you take classes you're interested in by taking them first. 

If you care about how this approach impacted my grades, I graduated with a Math major GPA of 4.07/4.0 and Masters CS GPA of 4.0/4.0 in 4 years. Certainly this isn't the best you can do or something to be necessarily proud of, but it goes to show that perhaps it's possible to do alright even if you deviate from the advised sequencing. It also turns out that because classes are self-selecting and curved differently, doing well in an easy class sometimes could end up equivalent grades wise to doing poorly in a more advanced classes.
