## Sample Technical Courses 
I proposed, designed and taught CS81SI AI Interpretability & Fairness at Stanford listed under [CS81SI archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200712083118/http://cs81si.stanford.edu/) in Spring 2020, with the invaluable support of my faculty sponsors Professor [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) and Professor [Omer Reingold](https://omereingold.wordpress.com/). For background on the class and similar class offerings, please check out this School of Engineering [post](https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/how-computer-science-department-teaching-ethics-its-students). For more information on the course, please feel free to reach out to me.
