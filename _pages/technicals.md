## Technical Interests 
I'm at the moment focused on learning about Explainable AI and Cybersecurity.

Previously I've worked on projects in Deep Learning research @Stanford ML ([Climate Change](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/), Coauthor NeurIPS 2019 CC 19'), @WBG ([Famine Prediction](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/famine-early-action-mechanism)), and [Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research](https://bmir.stanford.edu/) (EHR Patient Outcomes, Primary Coauthor WiML 18'). Last summer, I worked on improving image label granularity for company-wide Visual Search @ Google (for applications such as Google Lens). Freshman summer I worked on Genome Assembly software for Stanford Biology and worked on a deep learning project at a startup called Omniscience. 

## Sample Technical Courses
