## Technical Interests 
I'm at the moment focused on learning about AI Interpretability and Fairness. 

One recent project I was involved with is Stanford's Input on the European Commission White Paper "On Artifical Intelligence - European Approach to excellence and trust." The paper can be found on Stanford's Human-Centered Artifical Intelligence policy page [here](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-06/StanfordWonks%26TechiesEUAIWhitePaper.pdf). Another is a National Framework for AI Procurement [proposal](https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/a-national-framework-for-ai-procurement) through the [Day One project](https://www.dayoneproject.org/), which is a Federation of American Scientists project that identifies and develops actionable ideas in science and tech. policy. 
 
I worked on research at the Stanford AI Lab, advised by Prof. James Zou. One recent project I worked on is the effect of competing multi-agent feedback on learning can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06797).(CoopAI Workshop @ NeurIPS 20', to appear in AISTATS 21', [HAI Post](https://hai.stanford.edu/blog/when-algorithms-compete-who-wins)).

Previously I've worked on projects in Deep Learning research @[Stanford ML](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/)(Professor Andrew Ng's research group, CC @ NeurIPS 19'), @[World Bank Group](https://www.worldbank.org/) ([Famine Prediction](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/famine-early-action-mechanism)), and [Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research](https://bmir.stanford.edu/) (EHR Patient Outcomes, WiML 18'). Last summer, I worked on improving image label granularity for company-wide [Vision Semantic Service @ Google](https://images.google.com/) (visual search applications include Lens, Vision AI, OCR). Freshman summer I worked on Genome Assembly software for [Stanford Biology](https://www.morrisonlabatstanford.org/) and worked on a deep learning project at a startup called Omniscience. 
<!-- 
I came into Stanford interested in Bioengineering / Health Policy, and took Chemistry, Philosophy, and Energy Policy first quarter. Community and mentorship were (and are) important to how my interests evolved. Here's a [brief instagram snippet](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7kewSMh4MH/) from Stanford Women in CS on how I got started in Computer Science. Always happy to chat and share my experiences if you're unsure what a path in CS could look like!  -->

## Sample Technical Courses 
I proposed, designed and taught CS81SI AI Interpretability & Fairness at Stanford listed under [CS81SI archived here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200712083118/http://cs81si.stanford.edu/) in Spring 2020, with the invaluable support of my faculty sponsors Professor [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) and Professor [Omer Reingold](https://omereingold.wordpress.com/). For background on the class and similar class offerings, please check out this School of Engineering [post](https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/how-computer-science-department-teaching-ethics-its-students). For more information on the course, please feel free to reach out to me.
