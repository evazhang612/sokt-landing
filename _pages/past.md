I studied Mathematics (B.S) and Computer Science (M.S) at Stanford. If you're a current Stanford student conflicted about what to study, feel free to reach out. You can see some of my courses in Math and CS [here](https://www.evazhang.com/courses/).  

Here are some other places and communities I've spent some time at.

I worked on Google-wide computer vision and a vision project at Apple as an engineer. I worked on product.
