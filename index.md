I'm a Junior @ [Stanford](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eva-zhang), currently pursuing interests in mathematics, computer science, and tech. policy. Formally, I'm coterming in Computer Science (AI track), and intending to major in Mathematics. 

Here are some places I've spent some time at.

I came into Stanford having spent a sizable amount of time in debate and Model UN, and for the first quarter thought I would major in Biology (and thus took only Chemistry, Philosophy, and Applied Physics).
