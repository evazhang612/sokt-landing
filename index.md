I'm a Junior @ [Stanford](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eva-zhang), currently pursuing interests in mathematics, computer science, and tech. policy. Formally, I'm coterming in Computer Science (AI track), and intending to major in Mathematics. 

Here are some places I've spent some time at.

I was born in Shanghai, and live and went to school in Vancouver, Canada. Having spent a lot of time in high school debate and Model UN, I came to Stanford thinking I would major in Biology or Health Policy.
