I am currently pursuing interests in artificial intelligence, clean tech., and tech. policy. Stay tuned for something new. 

<!-- 
I'm a **Master's student @ [Stanford](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eva-zhang)**, currently pursuing interests in mathematics, computer science, and tech. policy. Formally, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (AI track), and completed a Bachelor's in Mathematics. Check out my [Build](https://www.evazhang.com/build) page for more specific technical experiences.
 -->
I studied Mathematics (B.S) and Computer Science (M.S) at <a href="courses" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.courses}}">Stanford</a>. Here are some places and communities I've spent some time at.

<!-- I've lived in Vancouver, Canada, Shanghai, China, and most recently Stanford, USA.

<!-- **Things I'm prioritizing learning more about in 2020:** 

- algorithmic policy, especially regulatory trends on fairness
- large-scale healthcare digitization 
- digital infrastructure, trends in education in developing economies --> 
<!-- 
Courses I've enjoyed at Stanford include *Groups & Rings, Biodesign Ventures, Energy Policy, Deep Generative Models, Philosophy of Love, Neurodegeneration and Intracellular Trafficking, Stochastic Processes*, and *Computer Systems & Networking*.  -->

<!-- In a past life, I have spent a sizable amount of time travelling for Model UN and debate. Arguing with people has given me useful practice for defending my questionable (or so I have been told) [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/evazhung?si=zAJdV4WNRiWQr3CUW8qswQ) and productivity habits in college. I'm not putting these on the Internet for fear of reader retaliation, happy to chat more offline.  -->

<!-- I'm currently working on a few projects for 2021. I would especially love to chat if you are interested in or have experience in algorithmic policy and AI fairness & interpretability.  -->

<!-- When choosing work, I prioritize learning. -->

I've recently started a [substack](https://evaz.substack.com) to document my thoughts more in 2021. Websites are great, but there's always something special about chatting in person (read: Zoom, for now).  -->
